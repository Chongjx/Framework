Game: Alien Planet v2.0 (Progress check 2)

*NOTE IMPORTANT*
Added fog, smoke particles and billboard
I will be adding more features such as sprite animation (and maybe shadow) into the scene.
The trees in the scene is yours because my photoshop got updated to 2015 and need revert.
I will also be changing my particles to render a 2D quad instead of a sphere to optimize abit.
The order of rendering will also be changed because now if the aliens are behind the trees(billboard), they cant be seen.
This is not the final product.
Final product will be much better in terms of coding.
*END OF NOTE*

The year is 2046 when human discovered hostile lifeforms on NOVA83. You are sent on a scouting mission but your plane crashed. 
Help is coming but can you survive?

Aim: Survive as long as possible until help arrive.
